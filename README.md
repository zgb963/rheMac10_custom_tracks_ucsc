## Purpose

Create custom tracks from macaque monocular inactivation experiment raw data (fastq files). Data here is for 1st biological replicate/animal which as 2 samples (MI1L and MI1R). Built custom bulk RNAseq pipeline to process paired-end reads for both samples. Goal is to see where reads map to on rheMac10 genome Feb 2019 and see which ref genome annotation is the best for our needs (has genes of interest, etc.)
